 This will get a static site up and running and provide a basic framework from which to move forward.

##Getting Started

####Install your prerequisites!
Make sure you have node and gulp installed:

`$ brew install npm`

####Install your dependencies!

`$ npm install`

`$ gem install sass slim` *Without the `slim` gem unhandled errors abound*

Note: make sure you can run `$ slimrb` after `$ gem install slim`, otherwise rvm may not be referenced correctly in your $PATH"

####Go nuts!
Run `$ gulp` to get a server going with browser-sync reloading.

Edit in `/lib` and let the `/dist` build itself as you go. Happy prototyping.
